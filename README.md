pyspec
======

Read pyspec is a set of python routines for data analysis of x-ray scattering experiments. It started out as a data class for the SPEC x-ray diffractometer control program (http://www.certif.com/) but since then has morphed into a suite of python classes for data analysis. This has lead to the “bacronym” for pyspec being “python routines for x-ray spectra analysis”.
